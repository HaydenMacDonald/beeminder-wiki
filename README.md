[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home) - "Your goals can be anything quantifiable — weight, pushups, minutes spent on Facebook, points on Duolingo. Answer with your number when Beeminder asks — or connect a device/app below to auto-report — and we'll show your progress and a Yellow Brick Road to follow to stay on track. If you go off track, we charge your credit card!"

# [Beeminder Wiki](https://wiki.beeminder.com/)

**What is Beeminder?** Beeminder is a service that helps you keep track of what you _want_ to be doing, but maybe are having trouble actually following-through. It takes data, either that you enter or that's automatically entered from dozens of different services (*see [Integrations](integrations.md)*), and it keeps track of data in a cool graph! The catch is that you set an amount you must do per day/week/month, and if that amount isn't met then you get charged money. That's the _sting_ of Beeminder!

  on Facebook, points on Duolingo. Answer with your number when Beeminder asks — or connect a device/app below to
  auto-report — and we'll show your progress and a Yellow Brick Road to follow to stay on track. If you go off track, we
  charge your credit card!"
